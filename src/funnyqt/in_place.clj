(defmacro defrule
  "Defines a rule with `name`, optional doc-string', optional `attr-map?',
  an `args` vector, an optional `pattern` vector, and following `body` code.
  Just like `defn`, overloading is supported as well.  The `pattern` vector is
  optional.  If no version has it, then you should use `defn` directly.

  `pattern` is a vector with the syntax of funnyqt.pmatch/defpattern.  The
  pattern is optional.  The purpose of this optionality is mainly overloading,
  i.e., you can have a rule like this:

    (defrule foobar
      \"Matches a, b, and c, and performs actions on them.\"
      ([g] [a --> b --> c ...] (foobar g a b c))
      ([g a] [b --> c ...]     (foobar g a b c))
      ([g a b] [c ...]         (foobar g a b c))
      ([g a b c]  ;; No match vector, just actions
        (action1 a)
        (action2 b)
        (action3 c)
        (action4 a c)))

  The `pattern` may include every pattern feature of funnyqt.pmatch/defpattern
  with the exception of :as clauses.  It may also have :extends clauses
  extending the patterns of other rules (only the other rule's pattern is
  extended; not the other rule's actions), or of another arity of the extending
  rule.

  The `body` may contain arbitrary code acting upon `args` and the elements
  matched by `pattern`.

  Rules expand to plain Clojure functions.  When a rule gets applied, it tries
  to find a match.  If it can't find one, it returns logical false.  If it
  finds one, it applies its `body` on the match returning the value of the last
  form in `body`, which should be logical true by convention.

  In general, rules consider the same options as patterns.

  Rules may have ^:forall metadata attached to their name or the :forall option
  set in the attr-map.  Such a rule first finds all matches eagerly (i.e., the
  underlying pattern has the :eager option set automatically), and then applies
  the actions to each match in sequence.  The finding of matches is done in
  parallel (if some constraints hold, and there's no ^:sequential metadata).
  The result of a ^:forall rule is the vector of action results (one for each
  match).  If you're not interested in that and want to save some memory, you
  can also add ^:no-result-vec metadata.  In that case, applying the ^:forall
  rule returns only the number of matches.  In any case, if there were no
  matches at all, nil is returned.

  Note that in a :forall rule, applying the actions on some match might
  invalidate a later match.  If that is feasible, enable the :recheck option
  either in attr-map or as metadata.  Then the pattern is rechecked before
  applying the actions.

  The same holds for applying a rule using `as-test'.  Here, the matching is
  performed at the call but you might apply the returned action thunk some time
  in the future when the model has already changed.  If that's the case in your
  scenario, again :recheck will enable rechecking the match before applying the
  actions.

  Also see `as-pattern` and `as-test`."

;;# State Space Exploration/Generation


(def ^:private statespace-schema (tg/load-schema "state-space-schema.tg"))

(defn state-space-step-fn
  "Creates and returns a function for step-wise state space creation.
  The state space exploration uses `init-model` as initial model/state, applies
  `rules` in each state, and compares the models corresponding to states using
  `comparefn` (usually `funnyqt.generic/equal-models?` is a good `comparefn`).

  An optional map of further options may be given to `state-space-step-fn`.

    {:additional-args   <seq of additional args for rule application>
     :select-rules-fn   (fn [rules] ...)
     :select-state-fn   (fn [undone-states] ...)
     :state-preds       <seq of predicates on each state's model>
     :transition-preds  <map of rule postconditions>
     :state-space-preds <seq of predicates on the states space graph>}

  The returned step-function is overloaded on arity and accepts these
  arguments:

    []                                  ;; arity zero
    [select-rules-fn]                   ;; arity one
    [select-rules-fn select-state-fn]   ;; arity two

  The two arguments may override the values given in the map of options.

  During each step, first the rules to be applied in this step are computed
  using (select-rules-fn rules).  The default select-rules-fn is
  clojure.core/identity.  If rules should be applied in a random order, use
  clojure.core/shuffle as select-rules-fn.

  Then, the state to whose corresponding model the rules are going to be
  applied is selected by calling (select-state-fn undone-states) where
  undone-states is the sequence of states to which not all rules have been
  applied yet.  The default select-state-fn is clojure.core/first.

  Then, each selected rule is applied using

    (apply rule model-of-a-state additional-args)

  so the :additional-args entry is for specifying further arguments to the
  rules in addition to the model corresponding to a state.

  The other three entries in the map of options allow for specifying validation
  predicates.

  - The :state-preds value is a sequence of predicates that receive a state's
    model.  If any predicate returns logical false, the state of that model is
    an InvalidState.  Else, it is a ValidState.  Thus, use this entry for
    specifying invariants for the model under transformation.

  - The :transition-preds value is a map of the form {rule [pred1 pred2], ...}.
    When rule is executed to the model of a state, each predicate of this rule
    is called like

       (pred old-model match new-model).

    If that returns logical false, the transition from the state of old-model
    to the state of new-model is an InvalidTransition.  Else, it is a
    ValidTransition.  Thus, use this entry to specify postconditions of rules.

  - The :state-space-preds value is a sequence of predicates that receive the
    current state space graph.  Use this entry to specify invariants of the
    state space graph itself.  For example, the number of states might
    be bounded for some transformation, thus an invariant might want to check
    that (<= (vcount ssg) upper-bound).  If that invariant fails, you
    probably have a bug in your implementation or you use a too strict
    `comparefn` which considers models different although they differ only
    in properties which are not important for the case at hand, e.g., the
    models might differ only in the order of references.

  Applying the step-function returns false if no rule could be applied, i.e.,
  if the `select-state-fn` couldn't selected some state.  Else, it returns a
  vector of the form

    [seq-of-invalid-states
     seq-of-invalid-transitions
     seq-of-failed-state-space-preds]

  where seq-of-invalid-states is the sequence of InvalidState vertices in the
  state space graph, seq-of-invalid-transitions is the sequence of
  InvalidTransition edges, and seq-of-failed-state-space-preds is the sequence
  of `state-space-preds` which failed for the current state space graph.

  The returned step-function has the following metadata:

    {:state-space-graph the-state-space-graph
     :state2model-map volatile-state2model-map}

  So this metadata is where you extract the states space graph and the map from
  states to corresponding models.  The latter is a volatile so needs to be
  dereferenced (e.g., @volatile-state2model-map or using `clojure.core/deref`)
  in orded to obtain its current value."

(defn create-state-space
  "Takes the `model` as initial state and applies all `rules` to it generating
  a state space graph.

  An optional map of options may be given.  For a description of arguments and
  options except for :recur-pred, see `funnyqt.in-place/state-space-step-fn`.

  If the map of options contains a :recur-pred entry, its value must be a
  function of five arguments which determines if the state space generation
  should be resumed.  It's signature should be:

    (fn [ssg state2model-map
         invalid-states invalid-transitions failed-state-space-preds]
      ...)

  If the recur-pred returns logical true, the state space generation is
  resumed.  By default, i.e., when there is no :recur-pred entry in the map of
  options, `create-state-space` returns as soon as at least one predicate of
  `state-preds`, `transition-preds`, or `state-space-preds` fails.

  The return value has the form

    [state-space-graph state2model-map step-fn-retval]

  where state-space-graph is the final state space graph, state2model-map is
  the final map from SSG states to corresponding models, and step-fn-retval
  is the return value of the underlying `state-space-step-fn`.

  This vector also has :state-space-step-fn metadata which is the state space
  step function used internally by create-state-space.  This allows for driving
  the state space generation further after create-state-space has returned
  because of a failed predicate or a user-defined recur-pred."

(defn explore-state-space
  "Fires up a GUI that allows for creating and inspecting the state space by
  starting with initial model `model`, the given `comparefn` (see, e.g.,
  `funnyqt.generic/equal-models?`), and the given `rules`.  For a description
  of arguments, see `funnyqt.in-place/state-space-step-fn`.
  explore-state-space returns a vector of the form [ssg s2m-map] where ssg is
  the state space graph which has been built interactively, and s2m-map is the
  map from State vertices to the corresponding models.  This vector
  has :state-space-step-fn metadata attached whose value is the step-wise state
  space generation function used internally."
