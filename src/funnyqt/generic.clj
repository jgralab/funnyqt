  `mm-file` is the file containing the metamodel (an ecore or tg file, or

  The `nssym` denotes the name of the namespace in which to generate the API.
  If `nssym` is nil, generate it in the current namespace.

  The new namespace (in case nssym was given) is required using the given
  `alias` (if non-nil): (require '[nssym :as alias])

  `prefix` is an optional prefix all generated functions should have given as
  symbol or string.  (This is mainly useful if the functions are generated in
  the current namespace in order not to clash with standard functions such as
  clojure.core/name.)

  `element-class-fn` is a function receiving a metamodel class and the
  `prefix`.  It should return a valid definition-form, e.g., a (defn
  <prefix>do-eclass [...]  ...).

  `relationship-class-fn` is to be a function that receives a relationship
  class and `prefix` and returns a valid definition-form.

  `attr-fn` is a function receiving an attribute name as keyword, a set of
  classes that have such an attribute, and the `prefix`.  It should return a
  valid definition-form.

  `ref-fn` is a function receiving a reference name as keyword, a set of
  element classes that have such a reference, and the `prefix`.  It should
  return a valid definition-form.

  The functions are called with all classes/attributes/references of the
  metamodel.

  Lastly, an optional `extension-hook` may be given.  This is a function that
  gets the loaded metamodel and should return a seq of extension code which
  will be spliced in.  You can use that for example to generate accessor for
  enum literals or other custom data types."

(defmacro generate-metamodel-functions
  "Generates a metamodel-specific API consisting of functions for creating
  elements and functions for accessing properties (attributes and references).

  `mm-file` is the file containing the metamodel for which to generate the API.
  This file must be loadable with `mm-load` which see.

  `nssym` is a symbol denoting the new namespace in which to generate.  It may
  be nil in which case the current namespace is used.

  `alias` is an alias under which the newly generated namespace will be
  required.

  `prefix` is an optional prefix all generated functions should use.  (That's
  mostly useful when generating in an existing namespace to prevent name
  clashes.)

  The following functions are generated:

  For any element class Foo in the metamodel, a (create-Foo! model) function,
  an (all-Foos model) function, and a (isa-Foo? el) type check predicate is
  generated.

  For any relationship class Bar in the metamodel, a (create-Bar! model start
  end) function, an (all-Bars model) function, an (incident-Bars el dir)
  function (dir is optional and may be :in, :out, or :inout [default]), and
  a (isa-Foo?  el) type check predicate is generated.

  For any attribute name attr, the following functions are generated:

    (attr el)          ;; Returns the attr value of el
    (set-attr! el val) ;; Sets the attr value of el to val

  For boolean attributes the getter is named attr?.

  For any reference name ref, the following functions are generated:

    (->ref el)                  ;; Returns the element(s) in el's ref role
    (->set-ref! el refed)       ;; Sets el's ref reference to refed
    (->add-ref! el r1 r2 r3...) ;; Adds r1, r2, and r3 to el's ref reference
    (->addall-ref! el rs)       ;; Adds all elements in rs to el's ref reference

  The add-* functions are only generated if ref occurs as a multi-valued
  reference.  If el's ref-reference is multi-valued, then the setter wants a
  collection of elements, else a single element."
